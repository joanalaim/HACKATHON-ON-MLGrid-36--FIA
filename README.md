## Abstract

Clustering time series is often hindered by high dimensionality and noise. We propose an unsupervised framework that compresses each series into four interpretable features describing the decay rate and sign pattern of its autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF). Using these features, we cluster simulated ARMA signals with K-Means, Ward’s method, and DBSCAN, evaluating quality via silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin, ARI, and NMI. The engineered features yield clear separation: $k$-means achieves the best internal scores and clusters tend to group series generated by similar ARMA $(p,q)$ settings, preserving interpretability. 

By contrast, clustering a 95 \%-variance PCA space results in poorer, less stable partitions, highlighting the benefit of domain-guided features. Overall, a minimal autocorrelation-based representation can power effective, explainable time-series clustering and expose latent dynamical structure.

## Dataset

The data used was obtained by the professor of this curricular unit. The variables correspond to descriptive statistics extracted from 18000 temporal series (namely, the autocorrelation function and partial sutocorrelation function) which characterize the time dependence structure of the data.

## Observations

This project is structured in two separate Jupyter notebooks for better comparison between feature representations:  
- **`p2_eng.ipynb`** contains the main analysis using the engineered features.  
- **`pca.ipynb`** applies PCA-based dimensionality reduction for comparison purposes.

The primary focus of the work is on the engineered feature approach, as it offers greater interpretability and more meaningful insights into the data.
